How To Run---------------------------
1)Move OSProject 2 into working directory
2)make (using makefile)
3)Run in order S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 S7 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5
4) S0 needs to run on dc20
S1 needs to run on dc21
S2 needs to run on dc22
S3 needs to run on dc23
S4 needs to run on dc24
S5 needs to run on dc25
S6 needs to run on dc26
S7 needs to run on dc27
C1-C5 can be run on any of the machines
5)It will either print the completion statements for each client or it wont.
In the case that it didnt the program reached a deadlock. (Is easy to notice)

My Servers are in a tre structure. Requests and replies are propogated through the tree.
The leaf nodes tend to send very little request due to being dominated by the higher nodes.
The amount sent is also affected by my Quorums.
For some reason server 3 completes the first request from clients and send the most requests.

The average time spent is roughly 34 ms spent trying to enter the critical section
The total messages exchanged to enter the critical section is exactly 8 by each client

Part A)
Time Between Request increased by a factor of(100-95 ms)--------------------------------------------
file:kali@SendTimeUp
The total messages exchanged to enter the critical section is exactly 8 by each client
The average time spent is roughly 140 ms spent trying to enter the critical section

Part B)
Wait Time Increased by a factor of 10 (From 3ms to 30 ms)------------------------------------
file:kali@Project2WaitTimeUp10.txt
The average time spent is roughly 126 ms spent trying to enter the critical section
The total messages exchanged to enter the critical section is exactly 8 by each client

Analysis----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Increasing the wait time or the time between request increases the latency. Both equally effect latency.
